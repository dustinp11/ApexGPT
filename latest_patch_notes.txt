Apex Legends™: Showdown Patch Notes
August 4, 2025
SHOWDOWN OVERVIEW
WILDCARD
Check out our dedicated blog here for all the cards you’ll want to have in your hand before jumping in.
LEGEND UPDATES
In addition to some Controller class updates, we’ve also taken a pass at two smokeshow Legends. Good to have you back in the meta, Gas Daddy and Bangydang.
CAUSTIC
Caustic’s gas should be deadly enough to live up to the fantasy, but lately it’s felt a little toothless. With the updates detailed below, Nox Gas has become something Caustics can trust to threaten or hold an area for a long time with windows that attackers can play around. Also, Caustic’s new Field Research perk allows him to gain additional Legend Updates—making him the first to be able to get all four upgrades at once!
BANGALORE
With a whole new Legend Upgrade tree, Bangalore’s been given tons of new flexibility. Among these new options, are new breaching mechanics that allow you to clear out entrenched enemies.
GAMEPLAY ADDITIONS
We’ve got three powerful additions to the Outlands with Showdown. Read on for an overview or dive into specifics with Patch Notes sections further down:
- Elite Weapons take the firepower from Ballistic’s personal stash and into your hands. These variants pack a punch and replace their typical counterparts for a limited-time. Showdown brings the RE-45: Burst, which swaps to Energy ammo and comes with a spin-up mechanic.
- Legend Amps are game-changing passives available in Unranked and Ranked BR matches. With five options to choose from, there’s an optimal Amp that could sway things in your favor in any type of fight.
- Locked Hop-Ups means that the looting for these boosts are no more. Each weapon comes pre-equipped with its Hop-Up waiting to be activated and unlocked for the rest of the match.
RANKED
Key adjustments have been made to better reflect your performance and risks. Entry costs, placement RP, and kill points have been tuned to create more room for performance-based variance and rewarding consistent well-rounded play. The updated Challenger Bonus gives more RP to players who take on and win fights against higher-tier opponents. And those aren’t the only Ranked updates in Showdown.
NEW: DROP ZONES
Drop Zones will start Ranked matches faster and fairer with squads automatically spread out across POIs. Before the match starts, you’ll see a preview of your Drop Zone with a ping-able map for strategic co-ordination before locking in your Legends. Loot has been fairly distributed across POIs, so no Hot Zones here. Keep your head up, though. There’s always the chance a neighboring squad will contest by skydiving in.
AURAS
Introducing a brand new cosmetic option: Auras. When equipped, your Aura will be visible in the lobby, Legend selection, and during podium moments. In matches: during dives, emoting in 3rd-person, and it’s visible for both of the engaged players when reviving or finishing. You can toggle your clout on/off in the Legend Locker.
Every player with access to Ranked will get the “Ascension Crest” Aura after logging-in after Showdown’s launch and it will reactively reflect your Ranked Tier going forward. Those still working on their Road to Ranked will be granted this Aura once Ranked is unlocked.
ACCOLADES
Time to recognize players and their squadmates for all that they do during a match—not just winning. From pulling off tricky double kills to expertly blocking damage for your squad, Accolades highlight actions that often go unnoticed, uncelebrated, and untracked. They’re designed to celebrate varying playstyles and skill, and can be earned in Unranked, Ranked, Wildcard, and Mixtape with each tracking separately.
Each Accolade has up to four tiers for you to achieve as you progress and they’ll award XP too. Post-match, the summary will show your earned Accolades and your Gladiator Card the top three. You can earn and record multiple Accolades each day, but there’s a cap of 2200XP for these per day. Find the full list and your tracking under Account Progression, including descriptions, targets, and those you’ve earned this season, per mode, and how many times you’ve hit them.
CHALLENGE UPDATE
We’ve updated our challenge system to try and help you progress more consistently no matter which mode you choose. Most challenges that used to require specific modes or had dual targets now count across all modes, making it easier to play how you want and still finish your Battle Pass.
To keep time-to-completion balanced, some challenge targets have increased and we've added progression boosts to some modes. For example, “Deal 10K damage as a Skirmisher or Assault Legend” gets a 2x progress modifier in BR to match it to Mixtape’s completion time.
This is part of our long-term goal to create challenges that support a wider range of playstyles. Jump in, play your way, and get rewarded just like before.
NEW REWARD FLOW
Based on your feedback around reward confusion, we’ve created a new summary to showcase your hard work and rewards without the plethora of pop-ups. You’ll now be able to see each reward (including those occasionally granted silently), how it was earned, and additional details all at once—giving you more time to celebrate those Ws.

PATCH NOTES
BALANCE UPDATES
- Peacekeeper returns to the floor
- Akimbo P2020 enters
- EVA-8, Hemlok, RE-45: Burst, Sentinel, Wingman
- EVO rewarded by Harvesters increased to 425 (was 350)
- Overhauled placement to guarantee spawns closer to the geo-center and away from POIs cores
- Spawn rate reduced to 8 or 9 depending on Map size (was 17-20)
Dev Note: EVO Harvesters haven’t seen many adjustments, so it’s time to shake things up. We’re removing spawns at the edges of playable space and preventing them from the center of POIs. This could lead to unfair starts where some levelled up quickly by chance, while others were left behind. Now intentional strategic moves will be needed to access Harvesters. With fewer of them, the chances of bumping into enemies is high, but the reward is too with nearly enough EVO to level up.
GAMEPLAY UPDATES
- Purple tier loot items
- Early game: fairly uncommon with a higher chance to spawn in high tier loot locations such as Care Packages, Vaults, and the Hot Zone

- Limited-time standard-issue weapons are replaced with one from Ballistic's private collection

LEGENDS
- Zone Overcharge: now continuously regenerates shields while in zone Taking damage stops this for 6s
- Taking damage stops this for 6s
- Ring Consoles: players can spawn a taller custom EVAC from Ring Consoles they have scanned
Dev Note: Controllers should have priority when taking key spots and defending, so we’ve buffed their perks so they can get to zone early and fight with less loot.
BANGALORE
- Passive: Double Time Speed increased by 5%
- Speed increased by 5%
- Tactical: Smoke Launcher Canister breaks and travels through doors Projectile speed increased to 2900 (was 2500) Pull out time reduced to 0.25 (was 0.35) Cooldown reduced to 30s (was 35s) Smoke now reactive: ordnance and abilities can disable it for 5s when used inside/nearby

- Refuge: removed, integrated into Cover Me
- NEW ECM Payload: electrifies Ult dealing 10 more damage, destroys enemy deployables
- NEW Medal of Honor: faster revives and passive triggers running towards knocked allies
Dev Note: Bangalore is always fun to play, which also makes her a prime candidate to buff into a flex pick. We’ve updated her upgrades to give her more choices and be a stronger balancing force overall. Similar to how other Controllers are set to answer highly mobile Legends, Bangalore can now be the one to tackle slower, more defensive metas.
CAUSTIC
- Damage Increased to 10-15 (was 4-10)

- NEW Gas Fighter: Tac recharges 300% faster while in gas
- Particle Diffuser: increases Ult radius by +50%
Dev Note: At long last Nox Gas is powerful enough to be scary, even lethal again. To balance this out, we’ve made it reactive to explosions and player abilities. We hope this makes Caustic feel powerful and more relevant, while offering opponents a way to counterplay if they’re smart about using resources.

- Assist window reduced to 3s (was 10s)

WEAPONS
LMG
- Widened reverse hipfire spread
- Removed improved scaling from high-tier barrels and stocks (Previous Hotfix)
- Mag size reduced to 48 (was 52) (Previous Hotfix)
- Widened reverse hipfire spread
Dev Note: LMGs were feeling especially oppressive in close quarters combat and reverse hipfire contributes to a lot of that. They’re a strong and relevant weapon class, but recognize that we need to tamp down on some of that spray gameplay.
PISTOL
- Increased damage to 25 (was 24)
- Decreased reload time
- Improved hipfire accuracy
- Added Hop-Up: Kinetic Feeder
- Added to floor loot
- Also found on Energy Arsenals

MODES
UNRANKED
Trios & Duos (August 5-September 15, 2025)
Wildcard
- Second Chance Revivals
- Legend stacking possible
- Self Revive Drop Kit
- Simplified Loot & Inventory
- Auto Looting
- EVO Orbs Level up weapons Reduce respawn timers Grant a percentage of shield & Ult charge Kickstart health regen
- Level up weapons
- Reduce respawn timers
- Grant a percentage of shield & Ult charge
- Kickstart health regen
- Return to core Wildcard experience
RANKED
- Match start: squads are randomly assigned a POI
- Pre-Legend Select: players are presented with a map preview of Drop Zone
- After Legend Select: players deploy via squad Dropship to assigned zone with nearby enemy POIs marked for imminent threat
- During landing: added warning for incoming threats if an enemy squad invades Drop Zone
Dev Note: Ranked matches should allow you to get into the match before it’s over—bad drops can ruin that and lose you RP. Drop Zones means that all players will land at relatively the same time and have a shot at survival without waiting for the Dropship to unload. Contested drops are still possible, but limited and manageable: no more will half the lobby drop on the same POI. You’ll get the best chance at loot in your assigned Drop Zone, but efficient looting is still important in case enemies invade.
- Heat Shields are disabled in Ranked
Dev Note: Stalling near the Ring and doing long out-of-Ring rotations will now be even riskier. You’ll need to rely on good positioning in order to survive into the late game.
